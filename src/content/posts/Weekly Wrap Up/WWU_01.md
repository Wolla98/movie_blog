# Weekly Wrap Up

I'll go over some of the movies I watched this week that I didn't think deserved a lengthy post about.

## Captain America: Brave New World (3 / 5)

Captain America has always been my favorite superhero, so it's a little hard to get excited over The Falcon as the new captain. It didn't help that the reception for the movie on my corner of the internet was nearly dead quiet. After watching the film, I think I understand why. The movie felt pretty mediocre in all regards. At times the plot was engaging, but other times it started to lose me. The plane fight was pretty cool, and there were times where Sam does unique things with the shield and thrusters that I thought was interesting. Most of the time the action was just okay, though. Sam doesn't really get to do much unique to his character other than talking down the president. It was a nice moment, but I was hoping for a little more character-wise from the movie.

The ending really suprised me though. I like the dialogue between Sam and the other guy (I can't remember his name) about how he's always looked up to superheros. I've been watching these movies for most of my life, so that message really resonated with me. I mean, it sounds cheesy, but there have been moments where I've been genuinely inspired by fictional heroes to do better in my real life. That's why I'll always defend Captain America as my favorite (and it's not boring).

The way I think of this movie reminds me a lot of Captain America: The First Avenger, actually. In that movie, it has a good first act and ending, but a pretty mediocre middle part. For this movie, I think it's whatever for the first half but gets better as it chugs along. Had a few moments that I liked, but didn't impress me. I'll give the movie a strong 3 / 5.
