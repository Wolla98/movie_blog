# Weekly Wrap Up


This is the start of a new Weekly Wrap Up series where I talk about some of the movies I watched this week. For a while, I've been watching some real garbage **cough** *Chronicles of Riddick* **cough** but I'm happy to report that this week I've seen some really good movies.


Oh and for scoring, I've decided to steal Anthony Fantano's scoring system with a bit of a twist. I use **Strong** to indicate a score I feel accurately describes the film. It's a score that I don't think will change a lot with time or on a rewatch. I use **Weak** to indicate a score I think might change sometime in the future, but describes my current thoughts. And, all scores are out of 5 letterboxd style.


## Captain America: Brave New World (2025)


Captain America has always been my favorite superhero, so it's a little hard to get excited over The Falcon as the new captain. It didn't help that the reception for the movie on my corner of the internet was nearly dead quiet. After watching the film, I think I understand why. The movie felt pretty mediocre in all regards. At times the plot was engaging, but other times it started to lose me. The plane fight was pretty cool, and there were times where Sam does unique things with the shield and thrusters that I thought was interesting. Most of the time the action was just okay, though. Sam doesn't really get to do much unique to his character other than talking down the president. It was a nice moment, but I was hoping for a little more character-wise from the movie.


The ending really surprised me though. I like the dialogue between Sam and the other guy (I can't remember his name) about how he's always looked up to superheros. I've been watching these movies for most of my life, so that message really resonated with me. I mean, it sounds cheesy, but there have been moments where I've been genuinely inspired by fictional heroes to do better in my real life. That's why I'll always defend Captain America as my favorite (and it's not boring).


The way I think of this movie reminds me a lot of Captain America: The First Avenger, actually. In that movie, it has a good first act and ending, but a pretty mediocre middle part. For this movie, I think it's whatever for the first half but gets better as it chugs along. It had a few moments that I liked, but it didn't impress me nor bore me.


**Strong 2.5 / 5**


## Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015)


This was a movie that I remember disliking on first viewing so I wanted to revisit it to see if my opinion has changed. I'm sad to report that I liked it even less on this repeat viewing. When people talk about hating "The Marvel Quips", I'm assuming that the imprint of this movie was so scarring that it had been permanently seared into their mind. Everyone talks in the same sarcastic way that gets grating when one character's doing it but becomes painful when everyone's doing it. Joss Whedon's signature style shines through in this one, and it's not very good.


Ultron felt like an uncompelling villain to me. His constant quips and sarcasm buries any chance of being actually intimidated by him. There are a few moments where his anger shows that I thought was pretty good, only to be undercut by a Josh Whedon joke seconds later that completely ruins it. The heroes joking around also makes it feel like nobody considers him a big threat.


The romance between Hulk and Black Widow was, to put it bluntly, not good. I think it could be interesting to see two characters who consider themselves unlovable finding love, but it's handled as just another punching bag for more jokes. Even Captain America becomes the target of the worst running gag in Marvel history with the swearing.


The one thing I did like was Hawkeye, though. I'm a sucker for regular guys going toe-to-toe with bigger enemies, and the movie shows a lot of love to him so I'll give it that. In fact, it's the moments where the characters get to be normal guys that the joking and the riffing becomes actually pretty good. The party scene and the scenes at Hawkeye's house are my favorite parts because we just see these characters bounce off each other in interesting, low-stakes ways.


**Strong 1.5 / 5**


## Ironheart (2025)


Ironheart is a show that really gets me scratching my head because there were parts that I really liked but other parts that I felt dragged the show down. Starting with what I like, I really like Riri as the main character. She's young but eager to do something which is great both as a character and driving the plot forward. I really like how a lot of the problems in the show are a result of her own actions and how the situation spirals out of her control the harder she tries to get ahead of it. It's not that often that Marvel lets these characters be seriously flawed in ways that the audience might not like, but flaws make the character feel more human to me.


I really like Riri's powerset, or at least where it looks like it's going to go. During the show it might as well be another Iron Man suit, but the magic-infused armor she gets at the end is very cool. The armor that fights autonomously is also something that I love a lot (mostly because I've had an idea for a character like that for a while). And, for the short time he was on screen, I really loved Mephisto. He's got the kind of charm that you want from a smoothtalking Devil giving you a faustian bargain.


But the side characters really killed my enjoyment of the show. A lot of the focus of the show is on Riri's family, friends, and the gang of criminals whose names and personalities I don't even remember. The criminals (who I will just refer to as "the gang" from now on) all have such little characterization that they are pretty much one character trait attached to a skillset. They could've given Anthony Ramos all of their skills and remove the gang entirely and the story wouldn't really change all that much. They don't even clash within the group at all like they all have a singular hivemind. They were a really disappointing part of this show, and their absence was not felt when they left it.


I didn't like Riri's family and friends for different reasons though. Her mother was a pretty uninteresting character who existed pretty much to tell Riri her flaws straight to her face and then tell her to get over it. All the other characters exist to gaslight her into accepting that her AI recreation of her friend is real, then double gaslight her into accepting that her AI recreation was never her friend and just an AI bot. This one guy who's name, personality, and relationship to Riri I genuinely can't remember, goes from being friends with Riri, hating her for creating an AI replica, then getting over that in the span of about 1 episode. He didn't even argue about it, something that might actually reveal some personality, he just one day accepts it and goes "yeah I'm cool with that now".


And finally, Riri's friend. This is just a personal opinion, but I disliked the way that she and her friend talked to each other. Not from any character standpoint, but it just felt a little too much referential humor and "Did I just do that" for my liking. The thing I take more issue with is that it felt the show expected the audience would just instantly accept that this copy of Riri's friend was both actually her friend and that it was morally okay to do it. At first, Riri rejects that the AI is actually her friend. However, both the AI and her friends tell her multiple times that no, this is really her friend, or at least just as good. Every argument about this ends in Riri being defeated without a strong effort like the audience is supposed to disagree with Riri from the start. The problem is, I actually agreed with Riri, so it definitely felt strange. Then, when the one character tells Riri that it's messed up to create an AI replica, he changes his mind without much struggle either. It's just *sigh*, it's disappointing.


Everything else is just mid. Anthony Ramos was okay but not that compelling. Obadiah Stane's son was an interesting character that did pretty much nothing in the story and existed only to set up future stories. Riri's magic friend was pretty cool but didn't show up too often. It's just that the main character felt so good only to be surrounded with so much that brought the whole show down. I might just be a bit harsh because I recently watched *Sinners* (2025) which was  a film that featured an ensemble cast of African American characters that I liked much more than this show. I'm not really sure how I'm going to feel the more I think about this show, but I have a feeling it's going to be worse on rewatch.


**Weak 2.5 / 5**


## The Prestige (2006)


The only other Nolan film I've watched was *Oppenheimer* (2023), which I actually liked quite a bit. I had it on good authority that this was one of his best works, though, so I had to see it for myself. They were right. Look out for a longer review later, because this one was really good.


**Strong 5 / 5**


## Superman (2025)


This was a movie that I intentionally avoided any spoilers for, not even watching the trailers. The only thing I knew was that James Gunn was directing it. Now, I'm not usually one to say that a movie will be good or bad because a certain director is working on it, but I think Gunn has a pretty good track record with these superhero movies so I was excited to see how he would do Superman. For too long have I had to hear about how Superman is boring because of Jesus-metaphor Zack Snyder superman, and I was hoping that this movie would be above that.


The action scenes looked a bit goofy at times, but I can't believe I'm saying that it's refreshing to see a superhero show focused on saving civilians. Superman frequently blocks attacks and buildings to save a bystander. He makes sure that people are safe whenever he can. When fighting the large monster, he even considers ways to get it off the planet onto another home. It made me smile, and that's about as much as I can ask for in a Superman movie.


Nicholas Hoult is absolutely amazing as Lex Luthor. The rage and pride that he brings to the character is just perfect. The Justice Gang was also great but Edi Gathegi as Mr. Terrific was a standout character in the film. He oozes confidence and charisma and it was a joy to see him on screen, even if his mask was a little stupid. There so much more I would say, but the movie is just good all the way through. Maybe I'll write a longer review later.


As an aside, it is very funny to see the reaction to this movie in my corner of film twitter. This movie has probably been in production for some years now, but certain plot points resemble some real world events that have been happening recently. So, there's a lot of noise coming over from the right wing pundit side of film discourse. Overnight I've seen the discussion start with "The movie is woke and bad", then after it made a ton of money opening week go to "The movie is good, there's no politics in this movie". Some part of me wonders how much of their audience believes them wholeheartedly and how much of them just point and laugh.


**Weak 4.5 / 5**


## The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966)

I've always been quite fond of westerns. There's something so engaging about these morally gray cowboys shooting people. And of course since I'm a nerd I like the revolvers and rifles of the time period. So, I decided to watch the godfather of western movies (and western movie references), *The Good, the Bad and the Ugly* (1966). Funnily enough I had actually watched a South Korean spoof on the genre before this one called *The Good, The Bad, the Weird* (2008), which I enjoyed quite a bit even without understanding most of the references.

Anyway, back to the movie itself, the first thing I noticed was how long the movie actually was. I don't usually do this, but I had to break the movie into two chunks to watch the whole thing because it's a whopping 3 hours. That's not to say it was boring, though. Clint Eastwood's stoic demeanor bounces off well against Tuco's more rat-like behavior. The camerawork was something that I was expecting to be good because it was a focus of a section in my film class, and it did not disappoint. The score, and especially the vocal stinger, is iconic.

One thing I've always heard is that gunfights are just inherently boring scenes for the audience and choreographer. I understand why people think that after the 40th minute of the hero gunning down the 100th faceless goon in Action Movie 12. I think this movie has excellent gunfights though. For the goons, it serves as a good display of a character's skills AND their survivalist traits. Tuco likes ambushes while Angel Eyes prefers to do direct duels, for example. And of course, the ending duel is iconic for a good reason. There's just something so satisfying about the one-shot nature of a revolver that modern gunfight choreography doesn't really use because they love guns that shoot lots of bullets. Anyway, that was just my nerd rant and why I think gunfights can be cool and interesting.

The movie was really good, but it's a lot. Definitely not for everyone, but I liked it.
